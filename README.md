# Project code is under the file name "move_generatorGUI"

# (unfinished)

# I need to complete favorites button

# I need to handle cases wherein all 5 numbers generated aren't movie codes

# I need to make text un-editable 


# How to run: I used intelliJ as an IDE to work on this project. To get it to run, in run/Debug configurations, I set the script path to the file location and just press the run button. I can also run using some other IDE's such as atom. To run the program through my temrinal, I change the directory to the file location and hit enter. Then write the the latest version of python followed by the file name. For example: "python3 move_generatorGUI.py"
